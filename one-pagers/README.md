# One-pagers

This folder contains short “one-page” summaries tailored to a specific role.

## Files (recommended)

- `Platform_Lead_OnePager.md`
- `Platform_Lead_OnePager.pdf`

## How to update

If you already have the source files locally (e.g., `OnePager_Platform_Lead_Rassvetalov.md/.pdf`), copy them into this folder and keep the names above to make links stable.

## Optional: stable sharing via GitHub Releases

For stable links when sharing a PDF, you can attach it to a GitHub Release as an asset (e.g., “One-pager”).

> NDA note: keep one-pagers public-friendly (no internal domains, IDs, bucket names, exact topology).
