# Zero Trust service publishing (Cloudflare Zero Trust)

## Problem

Secure access to internal services traditionally requires manual provisioning and slow coordination across teams.

## Approach (draft)

- Keep services private by default
- Authenticate via `<IdP>`
- Enforce access with Zero Trust applications/policies
- Integrate DNS into the publishing workflow

## Result (ranges)

- Access lead time reduced from 1–2 business days to 1–2 hours
- Manual operations reduced by ~30%
