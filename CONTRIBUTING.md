# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this repository.

This is a personal **portfolio** repo and is intentionally kept small and curated.
For that reason:

- I **do not accept pull requests**.
- I keep **Issues** disabled or auto-closed to avoid noise.

If you want to reach out, please use the contact details in `README.md`.
